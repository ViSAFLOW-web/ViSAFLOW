  <h1>ViSA-Flow: Accelerating Robot Skill Learning via Large-Scale Video Semantic Action Flow</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Enabling robots to acquire complex manipulation skills remains a great challenge, primarily bottlenecked by the prohibitive cost of collecting large-scale robot demonstration data. Humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution.
